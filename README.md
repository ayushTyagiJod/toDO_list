# toDO_list

They list everything that you have to do, with the most important tasks at the top of the list, and the least important tasks at the bottom. By keeping such a list, you make sure that your tasks are written down all in one place so you don't forget anything important.

Our overall top winner is Todoist. Todoist is the best to-do list app you'll find. It works on every platform. You can use it for free or pay a reasonably fee to get all the features.
